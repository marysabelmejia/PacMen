<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This activity involved using array methods previously learned and manipulating the DOM. With the click of a button, a new PacMan is created and pushed into the array. At the start of the game, each PacMan bounces around the screen at its own pace and in its own direction.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After loading the HTML file onto your browser, you'll see a blank screen with two buttons on the top left: "Add PacMan" and "Start Game". Click "Add PacMan" as many times as you'd like. With each click, you'll see a new PacMan pop up on your screen. Click "Start Game" to get them to move around your screen. You can also continue to add PacMen into the game, while it is running. To get it to stop, reload the page.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Change the background color to black to make it look more like the original game
- [ ] Create different colored PacMen when clicking "Add PacMan"
- [ ] Add pause button that freezes the screen
- [ ] Add clear/new button that removes all PacMen, so that you don't have to reload the page each time
